# Pong Game
This is pong for android, made for multi-touch. Two players can play on their phone at the same time.

This is my first game project on android. I'm getting used to drawing on the canvas and multi-touch before I create a 2d zombie game. I'll add a link here once that's done, if I choose to open source it.

## Run Instructions
import into android studio, plug in a phone then press play to install and run the game on your phone. Make sure developer options and debugging over USB are enabled on your phone.
